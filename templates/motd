==================================== KILL POLICY ====================================
- All VMs get deleted at night by DEFAULT.
- BUT! YOU CAN make any VM survive the night by running: "sudo touch /nokill"
  - "nokill"-ed "demo-xxx" VMs will keep running (don't power down).
  - "nokill"-ed "personal" VMs WILL POWER DOWN at night, but DON'T get deleted.
- To destroy a VM manually, run: "sudo touch /killme", and wait a minute.
- To snapshot a VM, run: "sudo touch /snapshotme", and wait a minute until the
  file "/snapshotme" disappears.
