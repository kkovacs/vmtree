====================================== N E W S ======================================
On this new VMTREE, some things are different from the old one:
- All VMs die at night by DEFAULT. Even "dev-xxx" VMs.
- BUT! YOU CAN make any VM survive the night by running: "sudo touch /nokill"
  - "nokill"-ed "dev-xxx" VMs will keep running (don't power down).
  - "nokill"-ed "personal" VMs will POWER DOWN at night, but DON'T get deleted.
- Running "sudo poweroff" to destroy a VM doesn't work anymore. Use "sudo touch /killme"
- People can ssh into each other's VMs IF the VM's owner puts in the ssh key.
